# Keynote to PDF

A pair of Applescripts for Keynote 5.3 (iWork '09) and Keynote 6.2 (April 2014 version) to semi-automate the process of converting presentations to PDFs.

It uses the print dialog rather than the Export... menu item to give more flexibility in the layout etc. I've tried to comment the script so that the selections can be easily customized. It stops once the Save... dialog is open, so you can change the filename before saving if desired. Written because of the annoyance of converting my slides to PDF for upload after every class.
